        <br><h2>Description</h2>
            <br><p>These yummy cinnamon apple chips will disappear almost as quickly as you make them! </p>
            <br><p>They're perfect for healthy snacks and easy to take on the road. The secret is baking at a very low temperature for a long time, which dehydrates the apples. </p>
                <br><h3>Ingredients</h3>

                             <br><h3>Steps</h3>
                                    <br><ol>
                                        <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
                                        <li>Arrange apples slices on a metal baking sheet.</li>
                                        <li>Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over apple slices.</li>
                                        <li>Bake in the preheated until apples are dried and edges curl up, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer apple chips, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack until cooled and crispy.</li>
